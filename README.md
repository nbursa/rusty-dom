# RustyDOM

My learning project RustyDOM is a library for creating and manipulating DOM elements using Rust and WebAssembly. This library aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage state and interact with the DOM in web applications.

Note: This library is a work in progress. Some features may not be fully implemented or tested yet.
